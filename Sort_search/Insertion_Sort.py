"""
We begin by assuming that a list with one item (position 0) is already sorted.

On each pass, one for each item 1 through nâˆ’1, the current item is checked against
those in the already sorted sublist.

We shift those items that are greater to the right.
When we reach a smaller item or the end of the sublist, the current item can be inserted.

Runtime: o(n2) average and worst case. Memory: o(1)
